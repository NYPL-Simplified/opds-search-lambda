# opds-search-lambda
An AWS Lambda function for getting results from Elasticsearch as OPDS.

This function uses an Elasticsearch index created with [a script from the LS Open Access Content Server](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/content_server/blob/master/bin/util/create_static_feed)

## Installation
This repository depends on the [LS Server Core](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/server_core) as a git submodule.

Run `git submodule init && git submodule update` after cloning to initialize core.

Create a virtual environment in `env` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

Copy `config.py.sample` to `config.py` and fill in the Elasticsearch url and index to use.

Run `bin/create_deployment_package <zip_file_name>` to create a zip file to upload to AWS lambda.

Note: this must be created on amazon linux ec2 instance to work on aws. Run `sudo yum install libxml2-devel libxslt-devel gcc libxslt-python` to set up dependencies.
